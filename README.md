# [@lindydonna](https://twitter.com/lindydonna) Conference Talks - 2017

I'm giving the following conference talks this year.

## Thu Aug 17 - [Visual Studio Live!](https://vslive.com/Events/Redmond-2017/Home.aspx), Redmond WA

### Serverless with Azure Functions – scale dynamically and pay per execution

Azure Functions is Microsoft’s serverless compute offering. Azure Functions is event-based, so you can trigger from a queue message, blob, a timer, or even a OneDrive file. You pay per execution and the platform automatically scales based on the rate of events. In this session, we’ll describe the concepts behind serverless computing and show how easy it is to author Azure Functions in Visual Studio. You can run, debug, and even trigger on events in Azure. For monitoring, Azure Functions integrates with Application Insights. This provides rich queries and alerting, making it easy to understand how your application is performing. This demo-rich session will teach you how to create your own functions using the best-in-class Visual Studio tooling. 

## Sat Sep 9 - [Seattle Code Camp](https://seattle.codecamp.us/), Seattle, WA

### A day in the life of a product manager
  
Have you ever wondered why most product managers seem to be in meetings all day? Do you work effectively with your product manager? I’ll go through some areas that PMs typically manage and why they are important to your business. After this talk, you’ll learn about the many teams that contribute to the success of your product, such as marketing, evangelism, and sales. You’ll have an answer to the mystery of what all those meetings are for, and why Outlook is our IDE. Finally, you’ll learn how your PM can help you be even more effective.

## Sep 18-19 - [DEVintersection Europe](https://www.devintersectioneurope.com/#!/), Stockholm, Sweden

### Go Serverless with Azure Functions

You’ve heard the “serverless” buzzword, but do you know why it matters?  In this session, you’ll learn about Azure Functions and how you can build applications more quickly than ever before. With Functions, you pay per execution, which can substantially lower your costs. The platform automatically scales up and down based on the number of incoming events. Serverless is useful for data transformation, cron processing, IoT, and even integrating with Office 365. In this session, we’ll describe the concepts behind serverless computing and show how easy it is to run Functions on your local machine. Using Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, you can even debug and trigger on events in Azure. This demo-rich session will teach you how to create your own functions using our best-in-class tooling.
  
### DevOps best practices on Azure App Service

App Service has a number of powerful features that make it easy to build an automated CI/CD pipeline. Learn how to leverage VSTS integration and deployment slots to create a deployment pipeline, and how to use Azure Application Insights to learn how your app is behaving in production. We’ll demonstrate how to use deployment slots to deploy safely to production, with no impact on end-user performance. You’ll also learn how to automate resource creation and deployment using Azure Resource Manager Templates and the Azure CLI. These features are not just for Web Apps that run on Windows: we’ll demo how you can also create an enterprise-grade deployment process on Linux Web Apps.

## [Not confirmed] Sep 19-21 - [.NET Conf 2017](http://www.dotnetconf.net/), Virtual event

### Go Serverless with Azure Functions and C#

You’ve heard the “serverless” buzzword, but do you know why it matters?  In this session, you’ll learn about Azure Functions, Microsoft’s serverless compute offering. It enables you to build .NET applications more quickly than ever before. Plus, you can lower your costs because you pay per execution. The platform automatically scales up and down based on the number of incoming events. Serverless is useful for data transformation, cron processing, IoT, web and mobile backends, and more. 
 
In this session, we’ll describe the concepts behind serverless computing and show how easy it is to author C# Azure Functions in Visual Studio. You can run, debug, and even trigger on events in Azure, right from Visual Studio. Once you’ve deployed your application, you can monitor it with Application Insights, giving you rich queries and a view of the health of your application. This demo-rich session will teach you how to create your own functions using our best-in-class tooling.

## Sep 25-29 - [Microsoft Ignite](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite/), Orlando, FL

### A day in the life of an Azure serverless developer

Serverless is a great computing abstraction. When combined with great tools, developers can be more productive than ever. In this session, see the end-to-end experience of using the Microsoft Azure platform to build your serverless applications. Through demos, learn how to build, deploy, manage, and monitor your applications. We focus on Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps and show tools such as Application Insights, Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code.

## [Not confirmed] Oct 9-11 - [ServerlessConf NYC](https://nyc.serverlessconf.io/), New York, NY

Talk TBD

## Dec 11-12 - Second International Workshop on Serverless Computing (WoSC) 2017 (http://www.serverlesscomputing.org/wosc2/), Las Vegas, NV

### Serverless computing - fad or revolution?

You’ve heard the “serverless” buzzword, but what does it mean?  Is it yet another fad, or a revolution in cloud computing? In this session, you'll learn why serverless is becoming a new computing paradigm, enabling developers to build applications more quickly than ever before. However, serverless is not the best fit for every application. In this session, we'll cover the scenarios where serverless works best, such as data transformation, CRON jobs, and IoT. Demos will focus on Azure Functions and show how easy it is to run and debug functions on your local machine. Go beyond the hype and learn whether serverless is a good fit for your workload.
